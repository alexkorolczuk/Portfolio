# Makao card game
 Makao is a popular international card game with pretty complicated rules. I created its command-line version, with visual representation of the cards.<br />Main purpose of this project was practicing Objective-C and planning multiple relations between classes, objects and its properties.

 ## Language
Objective C
  
  
 ### On going:
* Adding next game  rules: getting extra cards (2,3), waiting for your turn(4), demand cards(J)<br />
* Adding more than 2 players <br />
